      The following words are reserved for use by the JavaScript language and cannot be used to name variables (or function parameters and object properties that
appear in later chapters):<br>
abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char,<br>
class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do,<br>
double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally,<br>
float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in,<br>
instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null,<br>
package, private, protected, public, return, short, static,<br>
super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient,<br>
true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also a few words not reserved but really should have been, as they are an
    important part of the language:<br>
    undefined, NaN, Infinity
  </p>
  <p>The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as:<br>
    Single quote marks \'<br>
    Double quote marks \"<br>
    End of line \n<br>
    Carriage return \r<br>
    Tab \t<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Numbers also have some built-in methods, although you need to be careful when using the dot notation with number literals that are integers because JavaScript
will confuse the dot with a decimal point. Don’t worry though, there are a few ways to deal with this, which we’ll demonstrate with the toExponential()
method; this returns the number as a string in exponential notation. Use two dots:<br>
5..toExponential();
>> "5e+0"
  </p>
    <p>You can also calculate the remainder of a division using the % operator:<br>
      23%6; // the same as asking "what is the remainder when 13<br>
      ➥ is divided by 6"
      << 5
  </p>
  <p>
      The functions above look fairly similar but have their differences. I understood the first one easily
      because it was the first one I learned. The second one helps me to understand the third. For the second
      and thrid forms of the functions, you do not call the function itself, rather you call the const assigned
      to the function. The ones that make the most sense to me are the first and the third. I do not understand
      why you would name a function if you wont be referencing that name later on.
  </p>
  <p>
    The toPrecision() method rounds a number to a fixed number of significant 58 JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition figures that is once again returned as a string (and often using exponential
    notation):<br>
    325678..toPrecision(2);<br>
    << "3.3e+5"<br>
    2.459.toPrecision(2);<br>
    << "2.5"<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    ! (Logical NOT)<br>
    Placing the ! operator in front of a value will convert it to a Boolean and return the opposite value. So truthy values will return false, and falsy values will
    return true. This is known as negation:<br>
    !true; // negating true returns false<br>
    << false<br>
    !0; // 0 is falsy, so negating it returns true<br>
    << true<br>
    </p>
    <p>double negation (!!) to find out if a value is truthy or falsy (it is a shortcut to using the Boolean function we employed earlier because you are
      effectively negating the negation):<br>
      !!'';<br>
      << false<br>
      !!"hello";<br>
      << true
    </p>
    <p>The hard, or strict, equality operator, ===, tests for equality but only returns true if and only if they are of the same data type:<br>
      answer === 5;<br>
      Programming Basics 79<< true<br>
      answer === '5';<br>
      << false<br>
      null === undefined;<br>
      << false<br>
      </p>
