        <h1>Young Women Attendance List</h1>

    </header>
    <main>
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>To create a website where the Young Women's Attendance will be taken. This will be useful for reporting to
            the ward/s clerk the girls attendance and for ensuring attendance is taken whether or not the Young Women
            Secretary is present. Young Women will check their name off the list each Sunday. The site will keep record
            of the girls attendance and generate trimester report on the attendance. The site should also allow new
            girls or visitors to enter their names. Attending girls camp will also be included in the site as it is also
            needed to be reported to the ward clerk. When the Young women enter or check off their names either a song
            or message will display to make them feel special about attending <br>
        </p>
        <h4>Audience</h4>
        <p>The audience for this website is going to be the Young Women, ages 11-17, who attend church or camp meeting
            within the Burlington 1st Ward, the Young Women Presidency (President, First Counselor, Second Counselor,
            and Secretary) will have access to the site to view the attendance and report it to the bishop</p>
        <h4>Data sources</h4>
        <p>LocalStorage will definitely need to be implemented, for it will be needing to keep record of the attendance
            to generate the reports. Either using a JSON file to display the scripture or church music to be displayed
            after the girls have signed up their attendance. </p>
        <h4>Initial Module list</h4>
        <p>A module to collect and keep record of the girls attendance. Another module to do the calculation and report
            of the girls attendance individually and as a organization. And I think another module to play a song or
            show the scriptural message.
        </p>

        <h4>Colors</h4>
        <p><img src="/Week9/images/color palette.PNG" width="400px"><br>
        This color palette has good contrast and are colors I believed the girls will like. the purple and lavender will be the main accent colors. White and blue will be more for background and highlights, and the gray will be for borders or other decorations.</p>
        <h4>Schedule</h4>
        <p>Because I choose a project that hopefully will serve the Young Women of our ward, I plan on working on Sundays as well. I think that the project should take me 30-40 hours, and I should complete it in 4 weeks, for which I can spent 5 hours on Saturdays and 5 hours on Sundays. My Church meetings are at 1pm, so working during the morning on this project still leaves me the rest of the afternoon to spend it with my family. Also, on Saturdays I plan on working on this challenge from 7pm to 12am, that will allow me to finished other school assignments and have dinner.</p>
